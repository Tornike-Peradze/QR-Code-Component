## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was the first project that I have built using HTML and CSS. I learned:

- Basic HTML structure and elements;
- CSS selectors;
- :root selector in CSS;
- Centering elements using flexbox.

First, I used pixels as length units, lately I have modified the project, in order to make it more responsive. I used rem instead of pixels, and got rid of some CSS properties, that could have been expressed more flexibly.

### Continued development

I would like to work more on responsive design and CSS flexbox in future projects.
